  <h1>Designing the Conversation</h1>
<p>&quot;You probably know this already: roleplaying is a conversation.&quot;
(Baker 9) This idea has become fundamental to how I approach the design of
tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs): they're conversation games and can be
designed that way. This is what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation games are games.</strong></p>
<p>I use Anna Anthropy's definition of a game: &quot;A game is an experience
created by rules.&quot; (43) Therefore game designers write rules to create
specific experiences. For roleplaying games, a good way to do that is
to hook the rules into the story–the conversation the players are
having.</p>
<p><strong>The rules of a conversation game depend on a conversation.</strong></p>
<p><em>Pasión de las Passiones</em> by Brandon Leon-Gambetta is a great example.
Its rules depend deeply on the story the players are telling. Consider
this rule from the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you <strong>express your love passionately</strong>, roll with the questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you dressed to impress?</li>
<li>Do they believe that you are single?
... (75)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule only applies when someone passionately expresses their
love. It entices and draws the conversation towards it. The
accompanying questions then enrich the conversation deliberately.
They demand answers. They make the game about dressing to impress, or
failing to; about someone's assumptions of the relationship status of
someone else. Players can't follow this rule without expressing love
passionately, discussing how well they are dressed, and if they
believe you're single. With this rule, Leon-Gambetta crafts the
conversation—the experience of the game. This is what I strive for
in my own designs. I ask myself &quot;Where do these rules steer the
conversation? What conversation is caused by these rules? Is that the
experience I want my game to create?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Conversation games are conversations driven by rules.</strong></p>
<p>The connection between the rules and the conversation goes both ways
in a conversation game. Not only do the rules depend on the
conversation but they also drive it. A game with rules that depend on
a conversation but without rules that drive it is not a conversation
game. A drinking game is not a conversation game. The rule &quot;take a
shot every time someone brings up the Roman Empire&quot; depends on a
conversation, but it's a stretch to say that it drives the
conversation. In contrast, the rule we've been looking at from <em>Pasión
de las Pasiones</em> drives the conversation powerfully.</p>
<p>It continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... On a hit, your target gives themself to you or reveals a secret
they probably shouldn't. On a 10+, they also tell you whether they
love you or not, and who else they love. (75)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look how powerful that is! It's hard to have a boring or indifferent
responses to a passionate expression of love in this game. Instead, if
you're following the rule, you'll get spice and intrigue! It tells the
players exactly and specifically where to take the conversation and
ensures it'll be exciting. It drives the conversation deliberately
in a direction that the designer wants.</p>
<p>To bring it all together. This is my definition of conversation game
and it's the foundation of my design style.</p>
<p><strong>Conversation games are games whose rules both depend on and drive a
conversation</strong></p>
<p>Think about how your games in progress do this. Think about how the
games that inspire you do this.</p>
<p>Where do the rules drive conversation?</p>
<p>What conversation do they demand?</p>
<p>Does that serve the experience?</p>
<p>This is the result of thinking for a long time about <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/456">Lazy Play vs
IIEE with Teeth</a>
by D. Vincent Baker. It's worth a read.</p>
<p>While this idea came from TTRPGs, it's fruitful to think about what
else fits the definition. Robert's Rules of Order, for one, is a
conversation game. So are some Agile software development techniques
like Planning Poker and the Daily Standup. Robert's Rules of Order
aims to handle disputes, move the conversation forward, give everyone
an opportunity to speak, and manage interruptions. Agile techniques
have explored rules for iterative processes, fostering group
allignment, and just in time planing—all things relevant to TTRPGs.</p>
