# Port Hope

The Frost Plains should have killed me but fuck it, I needed to get
Port Hope fast. I needed the Angel there. It was written on one of my
cards. "The last Guardian Angel is in Port Hope". I write what I'm
doing on cards to get anything done. I'll forget what I was going to d
and go start something else otherwise.

I went for my pup, that was on a card too. "Semper Agustus needs a
doc". I have no idea what's wrong with them, they seem fine, but I
trust my cards.

// turns out the pup is fine but Dirt needs treatment

// dirt learns about the city during recovery

// city expects Dirt to pay them back by joining their police

// Dirt says fuck you, they learn that dirt is not to be fucked with
